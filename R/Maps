# But most of the counties on the map show as gray, so we can't really see the
# distribution pattern of dry lands very well.

# Now, the counties with top 25% proportion of land area were colored tan, and the
# counties with top 25% proportion of water area were colored sky blue.

# This time, we can clearly see that the areas on the west side of the country
# is mostly colored tan, and the areas on the east side of the country is mostly
# colored sky blue. From this graph, we can conclude that the west coast is more
# dryer than the east coast.

# However, this graph does not give any information about the scale. All the counties
# that are either top or bottom 25% land / waer ratio were colored with the same
# intensity of color.

# This issue becomes even more pronounced since the map is colored by the unit of
# individual counties. Since the west coast has larger counties, a few large
# dry counties colored tan can exaggerate the dryness of the west coast. Combined
# with the lack of dryness scale, if most large counties colored tan had lower
# land / water ratios than some smaller very dry counties in the east,
# this might have led to some overrepresentation of dryness in the west coast.

# However, even though there lies a possibility of exaggeration, the second
# visualization more clearly shows the distribution of dryness of lands.
